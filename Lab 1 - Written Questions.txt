a. When 23 was assigned to the variable radius through user input, it was a string. However, when doing mathematical calculations, you need an integer or a float.

b. I'm assuming that eval converts the information stored within radius into a number (i.e. an integer or float).

c. No.

d. You need to gather the radius first so that you can calculate circumference, as the formula uses a circle's radius to calculate the circumference.

e. When executing "radius" in the python shell, I get an error saying that "'radius' is not defined."

f. When I restarted the shell, my previous information was wiped, meaning that nothing is assigned to radius, meaning that radius wasn't defined, which means that there is nothing for Python to recall.

g. Using the Course SDP tasks allows you to break a problem down into different goals that need to be accomplished, you can take on different tasks to solve the problem one step at a time.
